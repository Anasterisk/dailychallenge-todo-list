A daily challenge generated by prompting chatgpt.

Create a "To-Do List" application where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

Here are the requirements for the project:

Users should be able to add a task by typing into an input field and pressing the "Enter" key.
Each task should be displayed in a list with a checkbox next to it.
Users should be able to mark a task as completed by clicking the checkbox.
Completed tasks should be displayed with a line through them and a checkmark next to them.
Users should be able to delete a task by clicking a button next to it.
The application should have a header that displays the number of tasks remaining.
To get started, you'll need to create a new React project and set up the necessary components to handle state and user input. You'll also need to create functions to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

Good luck, and have fun!
